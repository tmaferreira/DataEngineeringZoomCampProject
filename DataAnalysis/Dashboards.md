- **California (CA)** was the state with the highest number of accidents in this period of time (**~ 795.9K accidents**). 
According to a survey carried out, the state of California is the most populous US state. 
So, larger population in this state may be the reason for a greater number of road accidents;

Miami belongs to the state of Florida, which was the second state with the highest number of accidents in total;
- In terms of streets, the **I-95 N (North)** road had the most accidents in this period of time (**39 853 accidents**). 
Along I-95 in Rhode Island, several highway exits have sharp, sudden curves and poor road design, causing dozens of crashes and several traffic fatalities per year.
The **I-5 N (North)** road, which also registered a very considerable number of accidents (**39 402 accidents**). 
The I-5 is a major interstate stretching from San Diego County to the Canadian border in Washington State. 
Due to large populations, bad traffic, and tourist attractions, this is an especially dangerous highway in Southern California;

- There were some cities that only registered 1 accident such as **Jackson's Gap**, **Witter**, **Wilmar**, **State University** and **Hurtsboro**.
These towns are small and have a small population, which could be the reason why there was only a single accident recorded;

Main insights:
- In terms of accident severity, we can conclude that the majority of accidents were classified as **2**. 
Severity can vary between 1 and 4, where 1 indicates the least impact on traffic (ie, small delay as a result of the accident) and 4 indicates a significant impact on traffic (i.e. large delay);
- In most accidents, the atmospheric condition was classified as **Fair**, and it is possible to verify that there is a large part of the sample in which the atmospheric condition was not detailed (the value "other" was assigned);
- Observing the data, we can also conclude that there was a greater number of accidents during the **day** (**63.7%**);
- Filtering the data by year (between 2016 and 2021), we can see that there was a higher number of accidents in **2021** (**1511745 accidents**);
