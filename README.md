# Data Engineering ZoomCamp Course Project - Cohort 2023

## Preface
This repository contains the course project for the Data Engineering Zoomcamp organized by the by [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club/) community.
The project covers main data engineering skills taught in the course: 
- Workflow Orchestration: Data Lake, Prefect tool, ETL with GCP & Prefect
- Data Warehouse: BigQuery
- Analytics engineering: dbt (data build tool), BigQuery and dbt
- Batch processing: Spark

## Dataset
US car crash dataset (covers 49 states).
Crash data is collected from February 2016 to December 2021 using various APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs transmit traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors on road networks. There are currently around 2.8 million crash records in this dataset.
